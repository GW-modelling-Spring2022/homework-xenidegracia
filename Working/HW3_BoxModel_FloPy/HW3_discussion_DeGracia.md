*1)* A discussion of your answers to challenge.

*2)* Answers to the glossary questions.

## ***Discussion questions:***

**Q/. Does the equipotential distribution depend on the absolute or relative K values for the background and the inclusion? How would you use the model to test your answer?**

A/.


**Q/. Discuss what it means to say that, for steady state flow, there are equivalent Type I and Type II boundary conditions. How might this be useful in practice?**

A/.


**Q/. What would you find if you altered your model to consider unconfined conditions??**

A/.

### ***Glossary questions:***

**Q/. What is FloPy? How is it different from MODFLOW and how does it interact with MODFLOW? What are some advantages (easy) and disadvantages (harder) of using FloPy rather than building MODFLOW models manually?**

A/.

**Q/. Given that the distribution of K is always heterogeneous at the small scale, what does it mean to provide one K value per grid cell? What are the implications for the K values we use in models in general? How does this change if we are modeling with different spatial resolutions (i.e. grid cell sizes)?**

A/.

**Q/. What does it mean for a groundwater model to be confined? How does this simplify calculations of groundwater flux? How do we specify this with cell types in MODFLOW?**

A/.
